American Gangster (Non-OG. Alternative: original BD)<br>
Apocalypse Now (Theatrical Cut) (US Lionsgate UHD only has Atmos remix; IT Eagle UHD only has an earlier remixed 5.1. Alternative: German UHD &amp; US BD purportedly have OG 5.1 in AC-3)<br>
Back to the Future Trilogy (A handful of dialog has minor changes over the years. Alternative: LaserDiscs should have original versions)<br>
Big Lebowski, The (Comparison against Cinema DTS disc reveals that UHD mix is non-OG.)<br>
Blade Runner (Atmos track has later remixed effects. Alternative: 2007 BD Dolby TrueHD 5.1 is closer to OG)<br>
Casino (DTS:X’s surround channels are boosted compared to theatrical. Alternative: Cinema DTS or BD 5.1)<br>
Deer Hunter, The (StudioCanal’s 5.1 is sourced from 70mm mix but has a brief audio drop at one point. Their 2.0 is possible OG stereo and doesn’t have the drop. Shout’s 2.0 and 5.1 both have this audio drop, and neither sounds like StudioCanal’s 5.1. Hypothesis is their 2.0 is a downmix from 5.1, which in turn is an old remix.)<br>
Escape from New York (Shout’s 2.0 is a unique faithful remaster of the OG theatrical, whereas Eagle only offers 5.1 remix. Shout &gt; StudioCanal.)<br>
Gladiator (Non-OG. Alternative: Cinema DTS or Signature Collection DVD AC-3)<br>
Jurassic Park (Non-OG, but OG has distorted vocal. Alternative: 3D BD’s DTS-HD MA track seems to be best-sounding)<br>
Killing, The (MGM DVD has “the most balanced sound”)<br>
Labyrinth (Advertised OG 2.0 on the 35th anniversary steelbook is likely a downmix. Alternative: LaserDisc or 1999 Sony US DVD 2.0)<br>
Marathon Man (No OG mono. But the 5.1 remix sounds good and likely came from original audio stems. Alternative: Warner/Paramount BD has lossy restored mono)<br>
Matrix, The (Comparison against Cinema DTS disc reveals that both Atmos and 5.1 are remixes)<br>
Reservoir Dogs (No OG 2.0. Alternative: US/JP LaserDisc 2.0)<br>
Shawshank Redemption, The (Noticeable clipping. Alternative: 2008 US BD TrueHD 5.1)<br>
Shining, The (No OG mono. Alternative: 1999 Warner DVD)<br>
Taking of Pelham One Two Three, The (No OG mono. Alternative: MGM DVD or BD)<br>
Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The (Second Sight) (Filtered and missing a few grunts. Alternative: LaserDisc/VHS likely will have less filtered and correct audio. MPI UHD’s mono appears to be correct content-wise.)<br>
Thing, The (Non-OG. Alternative: Signature LaserDisc AC-3 or Shout BD 2.0)<br>
Top Gun (Atmos track widely considered a bad mix. Alternative: US THX LaserDisc’s AC-3 5.1 or PCM 2.0)<br>
Total Recall (Neither the US Lionsgate nor IT Eagle UHD has OG 2.0. Alternative: US LaserDisc) </span><br>
